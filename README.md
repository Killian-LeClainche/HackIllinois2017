# NeuralOR
An Open Source Image Processing Neural Network

# Introduction

NeuralOR is focused on innovative features and performance regarding the image detection field using :

Genetic Algorithm's
Neural Network
And other tricks

to provide a faster implementation of specific tasks that while other libraries adequately solve, they do
not solve them in a faster manner.
