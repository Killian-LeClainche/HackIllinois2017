We can also be found on various social media websites.

## <a name="pr"> Pull Requests and Forking </a>
If you want to contribute code, the best way to do this is to create a pull request. To do this, do the following: <br />
1. Fork the repository <br />
2. If you have already forked the repository previously, make sure it is up to date. <br />
3. Create a new branch <br />
4. Make your changes on this branch <br />
5. Make sure your commit messags are comprehensive and detailed. <br />
6. Document your changes along the way with comments. <br />
7. Test your code frequently. If anything in the main project breaks, we will not accept your code. <br />
8. Once you are done making your changes, create a pull request. <br />
9. Describe your changes with a small paragraph. Larger changes will require more here. <br />
10. Submit your request. <br />

## <a name="bugs"> Fixing Bugs </a>
If you find a bug, there are multiple ways to fix it. <br />
1. Fix it yourself. Follow the above instructions for creating a pull request. When you are submitting the request, make sure you give a detailed description of the bug. Tell us what it is, how it affects the code, and how we can reproduce it. <br />
2. Submit a bug report. We will keep track of all the open bug reports and work to fix them. However, the bug will likely take longer to be fixed. <br />

## <a name="best"> Best Practices and Coding Standard </a>
In order for your code to be accepted, you must follow these standards: <br />
1. Following these naming conventions: <br />
&emsp;  -Variables should be named using `camelCase`. <br />
&emsp;  -Constants should be named with `ALL_CAPS` using underscores. <br />
&emsp;  -Enums should be `PascalCase` and the enumerators should be written in `ALL_CAPS` with underscores. <br />
&emsp;  -Variable and method names should be descriptive. <br />
2. Curly brackets should go on the next line after a condition, rather than the same line. <br />
3. Break up sections of code to make it readable. <br />
4. Document your code thoroughly. <br />
5. Do not submit code with errors. <br />
